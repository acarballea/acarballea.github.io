								<h2>Work History</h2>
								<p>My background has primarily been within the fields of mental health and education. I was first a permanent substitute teacher for about five years with Oak Ridge High School. There, I mastered the art of flexibility and demonstrated it by taking on long-term assignments in many subjects I had little knowledge of. For example, I had to learn and teach Chemistry for about 5 months, while being a full-time student at UCF.  I also founded the Anime/Gaming club and managed it while fulfilling my duties efficiently.<br><br> In 2016, I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a bachelor’s in psychology and transitioned into the field of mental health. My career in mental health began with an internship with the Mental Health Association of Central Florida as a Mental Health Connections Specialist, meaning I would speak with callers who were looking for different types of services within their community. After this, I worked as a High School Admissions Counselor at Keiser University where I met with potential students and guided them while they made their transition from high school, to their college career. These two positions helped me develop listening and communication skills and allowed me to better triage and engage with clients to help fit their needs financially and emotionally.<br><br> Next, I had the opportunity to work with Aspire Health Partners (former Lakeside Behavioral Hospital) as an Intake Assessment Specialist. The bulk of my duties in this position were conducting assessment activities ranging from triage and screening to biopsychosocial assessments, synthesizing data into concise, yet in-depth reports, and utilizing reports as a foundation to recommended treatment and evaluation. However, I also had many opportunities to demonstrate my abilities in maintaining a safe and therapeutic environment, while assisting the providers with the Baker Act process. I was later offered a Medication Clinic Assistant position at the same establishment, where I worked closely with psychiatrists and clients to help in medication-assisted treatment. I was also granted the responsibility of traveling to our four other clinics to offer services as a Telehealth Specialist, which provided services to those who did not have reliable transportation. The client would go to a local clinic, and I would “bring the provider to them” by setting up a webcam conference with their psychiatrist.  Now I work as a Victim & Witness Counselor for the State Attorney’s Office, specializing in victims of domestic battery cases. These positions helped develop and fine-tune many skills, including interpersonal skills, problem solving, negotiation skills, and leadership skills. </p>
